This artifact for our companion paper “View-Centric Performance Optimization for
Database-Backed Web Applications (#273)” includes both the Panorama framework we developed and some raw data produced by our user study. We choose to claim for the Reusable and Available badges, and we hope this artifact can demonstrate the use of Panorama to reviewers and potential users.

In this artifact, we deploy Panorama in two forms, a Rubymine IDE plugin and a command line tool. In both forms, Panorama provides a view-centric and database-aware development environment for web developers through its two key components 1) Panorama profiler that helps developers understand the data-processing costs of HTML tags on a web page, 2) Panorama optimizer that helps developers identify optimizing opportunities and carry out code refactoring to improve the performance of a web page.  

Also we provide code and data used to evaluate Panorama in the paper: 1) the source code of 12 open-source applications used as benchmarks in our paper; 2) synthesized workload for each of these 12 applications; 3) the questionnaires and results of our user study. Detailed instructions to reproduce our experiments are also included.
