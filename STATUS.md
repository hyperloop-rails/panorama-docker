Panorama is deployed in two forms, a RubyMine IDE plugin and a command line tool.  In both forms, web developers are provided with a view-centric and database-aware development environment   through Panorama's two key components 1) Panorama profiler that helps developers understand the data-processing costs of HTML tags on a web page, 2) Panorama optimizer that helps developers identify optimizing opportunities and carry out code refactoring to improve the performance of a web page.  

Also, we provide packages to support repeatability of all the experiments of our companion paper, which enables users to reproduce the results for all the four research questions addressed in the evaluation section of the companion paper. 

Moreover, the artifact is available on the public docker image repository (Docker Hub) with this [link](https://cloud.docker.com/u/panorama/repository/docker/panorama/chrome).
